# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to Add a Changeset

1. Run `pnpm changeset`
2. Select the packages that have changed
3. Choose the type of change (major, minor, patch)
4. Write a summary of the changes

## Publishing

When changesets are merged to main, the release workflow will:
1. Create a "Version Packages" PR with version bumps
2. When that PR is merged, packages are published to npm

For more info, see [the changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
