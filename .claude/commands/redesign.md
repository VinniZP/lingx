description: "Apply premium design quality UI rules"
---
# Goal
Transform your app's visual presentation to convey premium quality and luxury while strategically addressing sparse content layouts that undermine the high-end aesthetic. The goal is to create a cohesive, refined experience where every pixel and empty space serves a deliberate purpose.

# Return Format
Provide a comprehensive design strategy that includes:
- 3-5 specific visual techniques to elevate the premium appearance
- Concrete solutions for addressing half-filled pages (with examples of what to add or adjust)
- Guidance on spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy that conveys luxury
- Recommendations for maintaining or improving user experience while implementing these changes
- Specific areas of concern (e.g., dashboard with three cards) and tailored approaches for each

# Warnings
- Avoid adding content purely for visual fill—every addition must serve a functional or informational purpose
- Do not sacrifice usability or clarity in pursuit of luxury; premium products are intuitive, not cluttered
- Beware of over-designing; excessive ornamentation or animation can cheapen rather than elevate the appearance
- Ensure consistency across all pages; inconsistent premium design undermines the overall impression
- Consider that "expensive" is conveyed through restraint, precision, and intentionality—not abundance

# Context
Your prototype currently has functional content but incomplete page layouts (e.g., dashboard with only three cards followed by empty space). You need to maintain the existing prototype's strengths while strategically enhancing its visual presentation to feel like a luxury product. The challenge is filling visual gaps without compromising user experience or adding unnecessary features.

# Important
Use frontend-design skill
