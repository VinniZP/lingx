Any translation function misuse (variables in t() without tKey)?\n\nIf you find issues, return 'block' with a brief note about what needs i18n review. If the work was non-UI (tests, config, backend-only) or i18n looks correct, return 'approve'.\n\nKeep this check quick and lightweight - only flag obvious issues."
