- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours

We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue promptly, and we ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before any public disclosure.
